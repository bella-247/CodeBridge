## Re-Test Instructions for Codeforces Solution Fetching Fix

We have implemented changes to ensure Codeforces solution fetching is handled directly by the content script, which runs in the context of your browser tab. This should resolve the "Session Error" you encountered previously.

Please follow these steps carefully to re-test the extension:

1.  **Reload the Extension:**
    *   Open your browser's extension management page.
        *   For Chrome: Go to `chrome://extensions/`
        *   For Edge: Go to `edge://extensions/`
    *   Ensure "Developer mode" is enabled.
    *   Find the "CodeBridge" extension.
    *   Click the "Reload" or "Refresh" button (a circular arrow icon) for the CodeBridge extension. This is crucial for the new code to take effect.

2.  **Open Developer Tools for the Codeforces Tab (NOT the Background Page):**
    *   This time, we will be looking at the console of the *actual Codeforces tab*, as the fetching now happens there.
    *   In your regular browser window, open a Codeforces problem page where you have an **"Accepted" solution** that you expect the extension to fetch.
    *   Open the Developer Tools for *this Codeforces tab* (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Option+I`). Keep this window open and select the "Console" tab.

3.  **Trigger the Solution Fetch:**
    *   Depending on how you normally use the extension:
        *   Click the CodeBridge extension icon in your browser toolbar.
        *   If auto-save is enabled, make a submission or navigate to a page with an accepted submission (manually triggering via the popup is usually more direct for testing).

4.  **Observe the Codeforces Tab Console Output:**
    *   Switch back to the Developer Tools window for the Codeforces tab.
    *   Go to the "Console" tab.
    *   **Look for log messages from the content script:**
        *   You should now see `[CodeBridge] Using adapter.fetchSolution for Codeforces.`
        *   Then, messages from the `CodeforcesScraper` (which is now being called directly):
            *   `[CodeBridge] Fetching submission page: [URL]`
            *   `[CodeBridge] Code extraction success. Language detected: [LANGUAGE]`
    *   **Report the outcome:**
        *   **If it succeeds:** Please confirm that the solution is now correctly extracted. Look for the success messages and verify the actual behavior of the extension (e.g., if it attempts to upload to GitHub).
        *   **If it fails:** Please copy and paste *all* relevant error messages and log outputs from the console. Pay close attention to any errors originating from `content.js` or `scrapers/codeforces.js`. This will help us identify if there are new issues with the DOM parsing in the content script context.
